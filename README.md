# Project 1
VaR Modeling
## Project Objective

This project aims to estimate the potential losses of a portfolio comprising selected stocks using multiple Value at Risk (VaR) methodologies:
- Historical Simulation
- Parametric (Variance-Covariance)
- Monte Carlo Simulation

The model will compute 1-day and 10-day VaR at both 95% and 99% confidence levels and compare the methods with backtesting and visual analysis.
